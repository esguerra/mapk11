# MD Setup for MAPK11 using BioBB

**Based on the workflow from BioBB which in turn is based NOT on an official GROMACS tutorial, but justim lemkul's**

***

This is not a tutorial but a public workflow for testing its utility on MAPK11.

***

## Settings

### Biobb modules used

* [biobb_model](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_model): Tools to model macromolecular structures.
* [biobb_md](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_md): Tools to setup and run Molecular Dynamics simulations.
* [biobb_analysis](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_analysis): Tools to analyse Molecular Dynamics trajectories.


### Auxiliar libraries used

* [nb_conda_kernels](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels): Enables a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab application in one conda environment to access kernels for Python, R, and other languages found in other environments.
* [nglview](http://nglviewer.org/#nglview): Jupyter/IPython widget to interactively view molecular structures and trajectories in notebooks.
* [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets): Interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/offline/): Python interactive graphing library integrated in Jupyter notebooks.
* [simpletraj](https://github.com/arose/simpletraj): Lightweight coordinate-only trajectory reader based on code from GROMACS, MDAnalysis and VMD.
